# CryptPad PFT Fork

This repository is a Post Fiat native fork of upstream CryptPad.

## Task Node launch bridge

The focused Task Node integration creates rich-text pads and spreadsheets through `/tasknode/`.
Configure the exact permitted Task Node origins before enabling the Task Node
Docs flag:

```bash
PFDOCS_TASKNODE_ORIGINS=https://tasknode.postfiat.org
```

The bridge rejects wildcard and non-HTTP origins, sends edit/view capabilities
only to the exact opener origin, and then redirects the popup into the new pad.
The product surface exposes only the internal drive dependency, rich-text pad,
and spreadsheet apps. Abandoned data is eligible for eviction after 180 inactive days,
archived blocks are retained for 30 days, and individual uploads are capped at
20 MiB.

Base upstream:

- Repository: `https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad`
- Imported commit: `9004ad2dd1b40d571b25f66dfe968606233f51a8`
- License inherited from CryptPad: AGPL-3.0-or-later

## Goal

Build a modern, open-source CryptPad distribution that:

- uses Post Fiat wallet identity as the login identity,
- supports Task Node style 24-word seed phrase wallets,
- optionally supports the existing MetaMask PFTL Snap flow,
- makes document sharing wallet-native through PFTL/XRPL logic,
- supports privacy-first Tor onion deployment without Cloudflare Tunnel,
- can later be ported into `pftasks` or run as a standalone instance,
- ships with a substantially better branded UI than stock CryptPad.

## Current State

The fork now includes the first Post Fiat wallet login path:

- Task Node style 24-word BIP39/XRPL wallet derivation.
- Canonical Post Fiat login message signing.
- Deterministic CryptPad account derivation from the wallet signature.
- Minimal wallet login UI.
- Optional encrypted saved-wallet unlock using PBKDF2-SHA256/AES-GCM.
- Session-only wallet login capability storage so a wallet login does not leave a persistent CryptPad `Block_hash` in browser `localStorage`.
- Nostr private sharing bridge for live CryptPad pads, including wallet inbox directory publish/fetch and share-by-wallet-address.
- Tor onion dev deployment with separate main/sandbox onion origins. Cloudflare Tunnel is deprecated as the default public test path.

- `docs/postfiat/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `docs/postfiat/ONION_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Key Recommendation

Do not make CryptPad contacts or raw share URLs the canonical Post Fiat access model.

The default private collaboration bridge is encrypted Nostr relay delivery of live CryptPad pad capabilities between PFT wallet-derived inboxes. PFTL/IPFS should be an explicit durable publication/export path with privacy warnings, not the silent default for normal sharing.

For privacy-preserving public access, use Tor onion services as the default no-KYC path. Clearnet TLS deployments remain supported, but Cloudflare Tunnel should only be a temporary debugging tool with explicit metadata tradeoffs.

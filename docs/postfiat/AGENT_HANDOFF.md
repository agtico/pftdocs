The fork now contains upstream CryptPad plus Post Fiat planning docs and the first wallet-login foundation.

Implemented so far:

- `src/postfiat/wallet-core.mjs`: Task Node style 24-word BIP39 mnemonic, XRPL wallet derivation, and message signing/verification.
- `src/postfiat/wallet-core.mjs`: encrypted saved-wallet vault helpers using PBKDF2-SHA256 and AES-GCM.
- `src/common/postfiat-wallet-auth.js`: canonical Post Fiat login/access messages plus wallet-signature-to-CryptPad-entropy derivation.
- `www/common/common-login.js`: accepts `walletAuth` without breaking stock password login, uses wallet-derived entropy, preserves wallet address casing, and makes wallet login idempotent.
- `www/common/outer/local-store.js`: wallet logins store CryptPad login capabilities in `sessionStorage` only, ignore stale persisted wallet-looking `Block_hash` values, and expose `BroadcastChannel` helpers for future explicit cross-tab unlock.
- `www/drive/main.js` and `www/login/main.js`: do not silently import an active wallet session; new tabs must unlock explicitly unless an explicit UI is added later.
- `www/common/postfiat-wallet-core.bundle.js`: browser bundle for mnemonic derivation and message signing.
- `config/config.example.js`, `lib/env.js`, and `lib/http-worker.js`: public `postFiat.walletFirst`, `postFiat.disableLegacyLogin`, `postFiat.pftl`, and `postFiat.nostr` config exposed through `/api/config`.
- `customize.dist/pages/login.js` and `www/login/main.js`: wallet-first login surface with generated 24-word wallet creation, seed phrase restore, encrypted saved-wallet unlock, and legacy username/password login behind a compatibility button by default.
- `src/postfiat/wallet-core.mjs`: session-only encrypted mnemonic handoff using a non-extractable AES-GCM key in IndexedDB plus encrypted material in `sessionStorage`.
- `src/postfiat/key-registry.mjs`: recipient X25519 key parsing with Task Node `MessageKey` preferred over legacy Domain `x25519:`, plus an AccountSet transaction shape helper for MessageKey publication.
- `src/postfiat/nostr-identity.mjs`: PFT wallet-signature-derived Nostr keypair and wallet -> Nostr pubkey -> relay directory record helpers.
- `src/postfiat/live-pad-share.mjs`: canonical plaintext envelope for packaging live CryptPad pad capabilities before encrypted Nostr delivery, plus explicit durable PFTL envelope plumbing.
- `src/postfiat/nostr-private-share.mjs`: NIP-44 v2 encryption/decryption, NIP-01 event signing/verification, and NIP-59-style seal/gift-wrap helpers for private live-pad shares.
- `src/postfiat/nostr-relay-client.mjs`: relay WebSocket helpers for publishing gift wraps and fetching recipient inbox gift wraps.
- `src/postfiat/private-share-workflow.mjs`: UI-ready workflow that derives sender/recipient Nostr identity from PFT mnemonics, selects recipient/config relays, accepts full recipient directory records or raw recipient Nostr pubkeys, publishes private live-pad shares, and opens fetched shares.
- `src/postfiat/private-share-workflow.mjs`: public Nostr wallet-directory publish/fetch for resolving a PFT wallet address to its private-share inbox key and relay set.
- `www/common/postfiat-private-share.bundle.js`: browser IIFE bundle exposing the private-share workflow as `window.PostFiatPrivateShare`.
- `www/common/postfiat-private-share-contacts.js`: encrypted-account saved recipients for private-share contacts.
- `src/postfiat/wallet-core.mjs`: Task Node `pf.ptr/v4` account history loading plus an indexed `pftasks` snapshot loader that normalizes context revisions, task events, and submissions, then hydrates/decrypts IPFS CIDs with the unlocked wallet mnemonic.
- `www/common/sframe-common-outer.js`: `Q_POSTFIAT_TASKNODE` can use the indexed snapshot loader when callers provide `indexedData`/`snapshot`; otherwise it keeps the PFTL `account_tx` path.
- `www/app/inner.js`: Post Fiat shell includes an `AI` page for browser-local Ambient and OpenRouter API keys with direct provider status checks, provider selection, and an OpenRouter model selector. OpenRouter is configured for ZDR-only request defaults with `provider.zdr=true` and `provider.data_collection="deny"`, and the selector uses OpenRouter's live ZDR endpoint list when available. These keys/settings are not CryptPad document content and are not covered by document E2E encryption.
- `www/app/inner.js`: Post Fiat shell includes a `/app/#chat` route with a ChatGPT-style two-pane chat layout. The source popup can include the latest decrypted Task Node Context Doc, readable Task Node task history, and selected CryptPad documents by name, then sends that browser-assembled context directly to the configured AI provider.
- `www/pad/app-pad.less`: stock pad Users drawer/toggle is hidden in the default document workspace to keep the editor/chat surface focused.
- `www/common/inner/share.js`: Post Fiat is now the primary share tab when `postFiat` config is present; it copies the current wallet inbox JSON and publishes live-pad gift wraps to relay(s).
- `www/common/drive-ui.js`: Drive now has a first-pass "Shared with me" Post Fiat inbox button that fetches/decrypts relay gift wraps and lets users open or save received pad links.
- `scripts/postfiat-onion-dev.sh`: repeatable user-local Tor onion runner for main/sandbox origins. `npm run dev:onion` starts Tor, writes gitignored `config/config.js`, and runs CryptPad on localhost.
- `scripts/tests/postfiat-*.test.*`: focused unit tests for wallet derivation, signing, entropy derivation, PFT channel bytes, wallet session storage, key registry parsing, Nostr identity/directory records, NIP-44/NIP-59 wrapping, relay publish/fetch helpers, full private-share workflow, and live-pad share payloads.
- `docs/postfiat/UX_SPEC.md`: target PFT Docs product UX, including the `/app/` shell, document workspace, editor shell, share-to-wallet flow, inbox, contacts, durable publishing, mobile layout, and UX implementation burndown.

Architecture pivot to preserve privacy:

- PFT remains the identity, entitlement, recovery, and payment layer.
- Nostr-style encrypted relay delivery should be the default document share/chat transport.
- PFTL/IPFS should be an explicit durable publication/export path, not normal sharing.
- Future Orchard/shielded PFTL work protects transaction metadata but does not by itself hide IPFS CIDs, pinning providers, gateway access, or durable pointer existence.
- Cloudflare Tunnel is deprecated as the default public test path. Use Tor onion services for no-KYC/no-origin-IP access, or a VPS/Caddy/WireGuard edge for clearnet deployments with explicit trust tradeoffs.

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. Add browser e2e coverage for wallet-first login, seed login, saved-wallet unlock, session lock, and drive recovery.
2. Add browser e2e coverage through Tor SOCKS for onion `/login/`, `/app/`, websocket connection, and a live pad load.
3. Add browser-level integration tests against a local or fake Nostr relay, including the share-modal tab and Drive inbox.
4. Add browser e2e coverage for wallet-directory publish/fetch and share-by-wallet-address.
5. Start the UX migration with `/app/`: Post Fiat shell, wallet badge, document list, and redirect wallet login away from stock `/drive/`.
6. Replace the modal-based share experience with the dedicated `Share to wallet` sheet from `docs/postfiat/UX_SPEC.md`.
7. Keep PFTL/IPFS durable publishing behind explicit UX and privacy warnings.

## Key Technical Decisions Already Made

- Primary login identity is the XRPL classic wallet address.
- Primary wallet UX is Task Node 24-word seed phrase.
- Username/password login is legacy compatibility. Keep it hidden by default, and only hard-disable it with `postFiat.disableLegacyLogin` after account migration is solved.
- MetaMask/PFTL Snap support is de-scoped from MVP. Treat external wallet providers as later adapters after Task Node seed login and Nostr private sharing are solid.
- Canonical private share model is encrypted Nostr relay delivery of live-pad capability payloads.
- Durable/publication share model is PFTL v3 ContentBlob/AccessManifest plus XRPL pointer memo, used only when the user explicitly chooses durable publication/export.
- Raw CryptPad URL sharing should be legacy/advanced, not the main PFT UX.
- Task Node read-only history can be loaded from PFTL `account_tx` pointers when the RPC has history, or from indexed `pftasks` rows when the app already has context/task/submission data. Both paths must reuse the same wallet-derived X25519 decrypt flow.
- Onion service deployment is the canonical privacy-preserving public access path. Cloudflare Tunnel is a temporary debugging fallback only.
- IPFS/PFTL should not be the silent default because CIDs, pinning providers, gateways, timing, and retention can create a document activity trail even if payments are shielded.
- Revocation requires file-key/content rotation.
- Wallet login should not leave a persistent CryptPad `Block_hash` in `localStorage`; it should unlock the current browser session only.
- Manually opened new tabs should not silently borrow the active wallet session. If explicit cross-tab unlock is added later, it must be user-initiated.
- Saved wallet vaults are encrypted locally with PBKDF2-SHA256/AES-GCM; the vault unlock password is not a CryptPad password.
- Nostr relay privacy is not perfect: relays can observe IPs, timing, relay choices, event sizes, and retention. Support PFT-operated private relays, user relay overrides, and eventually proxy/Tor-friendly relay access.

## Known Traps

- The previous PFT CryptPad prototype has debug logging in login paths. Remove it when porting.
- Previous theme injection used repeated timeouts because CryptPad LESS loaded after custom CSS. Replace this with a cleaner load-order solution if possible.
- `sprs/app/services/auth.py` warns its DB-backed SQL path uses string interpolation and needs parameterization before activation.
- `sprs` CryptPad escrow is centralized and seed-unlock dependent; use it only as a reference/migration path, not the canonical open-source sharing model.
- `tasknode-wallet` uses XRPL family seeds today; use `pftasks/app/src/lib/wallet` for the current 24-word mnemonic implementation.
- `pftasks` encrypted-wallet localStorage backup should be security-reviewed before copying.
- Stock CryptPad treats `Block_hash` as the login capability. Do not persist wallet-derived `Block_hash` outside the current session.
- The current configured testnet RPC can return zero `account_tx` rows for an active high-history wallet; do not assume ledger history is available. Prefer the indexed snapshot bridge for local `pftasks`/CryptPad integration until the RPC history path is proven.

## Smoke Test Targets For The First Implementation PR

- Create a 24-word wallet.
- Lock and unlock it.
- Derive the same wallet address after restore.
- Sign the canonical login message.
- Login/register into CryptPad with wallet-derived account material.
- Reload the browser and recover the same drive.
- Open a new same-origin `/drive/` tab while the first wallet tab is still unlocked and confirm it does not silently unlock.
- Share a live pad to a second wallet through encrypted Nostr relay delivery.
- Recipient decrypts the private inbox payload and opens/imports the pad.
- Load Task Node context/task history from indexed `pftasks` rows and decrypt the latest context CID through IPFS with the unlocked wallet.
- Load `/login/` and at least one live pad through Tor SOCKS against the onion main/sandbox origins.
- Durable PFTL/IPFS publication remains an explicit advanced flow with privacy warnings.

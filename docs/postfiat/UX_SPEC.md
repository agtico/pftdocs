# PFT Docs UX Spec

## Product Direction

This should feel like a Post Fiat document workspace that happens to use CryptPad's realtime encrypted editor engine. Users should not have to understand CryptPad accounts, raw capability URLs, unsafe/safe iframe boundaries, or saved browser vault mechanics.

Primary product objects:

- wallet
- document
- contact
- private share
- inbox message
- durable publication

Primary user promise:

```text
Open your PFT wallet, create private documents, and share them to other PFT wallets without putting the share graph on-chain by default.
```

## Navigation Model

### App Shell

Use a new Post Fiat shell as the default logged-in experience.

Top bar:

- app name: `PFT Docs`
- global search
- `New` button
- wallet badge: address, lock state, copy address
- relay/network status
- settings icon

Left rail:

- `Docs`
- `Shared with me`
- `Sent`
- `Task Node`
- `Chat`
- `AI`
- `Contacts`
- `Durable`
- `Settings`

Main content should be dense and operational. No hero pages, no marketing cards, no giant CryptPad-style icon walls.

### Routes

Recommended product routes:

```text
/app/                 workspace home
/app/docs/            owned/recent documents
/app/shared/          encrypted Nostr inbox
/app/sent/            sent private shares
/app/tasknode/        wallet-derived Task Node history
/app/chat/            AI chat with selected docs/tasks/context
/app/ai/              local AI provider keys and status checks
/app/contacts/        wallet contacts
/app/durable/         explicit PFTL/IPFS publications
/app/settings/        wallet, relays, instance config
/doc/:id              editor shell around a live CryptPad pad
/login/               wallet-first login only
```

The existing CryptPad `/drive/` route can remain available during migration but should not be the primary destination after wallet login.

## Login UX

### Login Screen

Default screen:

- `Unlock saved wallet`
- `Restore with seed phrase`
- `Create new wallet`

Secondary compatibility action:

- `Use legacy CryptPad login`

Do not show username/password as the default. Do not call the vault password a username or account password. The copy should make the model clear:

```text
Wallet password
Unlocks the encrypted wallet saved on this browser.
```

### Create Wallet

Flow:

1. Generate a 24-word seed phrase.
2. Require the user to confirm they saved it.
3. Set a local wallet password.
4. Save encrypted browser vault.
5. Open `/app/`.

### Restore Wallet

Flow:

1. Paste 24-word seed phrase.
2. Derive and show wallet address.
3. Optional: save encrypted wallet on this browser.
4. Open `/app/`.

### Session Rules

The visible app shell has one wallet state:

- `Unlocked`
- `Locked`
- `No saved wallet`
- `Wrong wallet for this account`

Any surface that can open a document under a wallet account must be able to ask the shell for the active wallet session. Users should never see a share modal that says `No saved wallet found` while the document is already open under the same wallet.

## Workspace Home

### Docs View

Default columns:

- document title
- type
- owner wallet
- last opened
- shared state
- actions

Primary actions:

- open
- share
- rename
- move/archive

Filters:

- all
- owned by me
- shared by me
- recently opened
- archived

### Empty State

Show direct creation actions:

- `New document`
- `Import`
- `Open shared document`

Avoid explanatory marketing text.

## Editor Shell

The editor should be full viewport, with CryptPad embedded as the editing engine.

Header:

- back to workspace
- document title
- sync state
- participant count
- `Share`
- overflow menu

Right panel tabs:

- `Share`
- `Chat`
- `Info`
- `History`

CryptPad's native editor toolbar can remain inside the editor where necessary, but drive/share/account controls should move to the Post Fiat shell.

## Share UX

### Primary Share Modal

Title:

```text
Share to wallet
```

Fields:

- recipient: contact search or PFT wallet address
- permission: segmented control, `View` / `Edit`
- optional note
- relay policy: compact status line, expandable advanced settings

Primary action:

```text
Send private share
```

Result:

- show delivery status by relay
- save recipient as contact when successful
- show `Open sent record` only if sent-share tracking exists

### Recipient Resolution

If recipient is a known contact:

- use saved wallet directory and relay set

If recipient is a wallet address:

- fetch wallet directory from configured relays
- if missing, show a clear blocked state:

```text
This wallet has not published a private sharing inbox yet.
```

Recovery actions:

- copy invite request
- enter inbox JSON manually
- advanced: enter Nostr pubkey and relay list

### Advanced Share

Collapsed section:

- copy raw CryptPad link
- copy inbox JSON
- custom relay list
- durable publish

Raw links should be labeled as compatibility/advanced. They should not be the primary CTA.

## Shared With Me

Inbox view should feel like email, not a debugging panel.

Rows:

- document title
- sender wallet/contact
- permission
- received time
- relay source
- actions: open, save to docs, archive

States:

- refreshing
- no shares
- some relays unavailable
- undecryptable message
- sender unknown

Undecryptable or malformed relay events should be hidden behind a compact diagnostics drawer.

## Sent Shares

Show shares published from this wallet:

- document
- recipient wallet/contact
- permission
- relay delivery status
- sent time

Important language:

```text
Removing a share stops future discovery where possible. Anyone who already opened the document may still retain access unless the document is rotated.
```

For live CryptPad pads, revocation must not overpromise.

## Contacts

Contact object:

- display name
- wallet address
- Nostr inbox pubkey
- preferred relays
- last successful share
- verification status

Primary actions:

- share
- edit
- copy address
- refresh inbox directory

Contacts should remove the need to paste pubkeys or inbox JSON after first setup.

## Durable Publishing

Durable PFTL/IPFS publishing must be an explicit workspace area and editor action. It is not normal sharing.

Entry points:

- `/app/durable/`
- editor overflow: `Publish durable copy`

Before publishing, show a privacy review:

- document CID may be observable
- pinning provider may observe timing/IP
- gateways may observe fetches
- ledger pointers may be durable
- revocation requires content/key rotation

Primary CTA:

```text
Publish durable copy
```

Do not silently create IPFS manifests or PFTL pointers from normal share actions.

## Settings

Settings sections:

- Wallet
- Relays
- Privacy
- Instance
- Legacy CryptPad

Wallet:

- address
- lock wallet
- save/remove browser vault
- export public inbox directory
- rotate private sharing inbox

Relays:

- PFT default relays
- user relays
- private relay proxy status
- test relay connectivity

AI provider keys:

- selected provider: Ambient or OpenRouter
- Ambient API key
- OpenRouter API key
- OpenRouter model selector
- OpenRouter ZDR-only request defaults: `provider.zdr=true` and `provider.data_collection="deny"`
- live OpenRouter ZDR endpoint/model status when available
- browser-local storage status
- provider key check status
- explicit notice that provider API keys are not CryptPad document content, are not protected by document E2E encryption, and are sent directly to the selected provider when checked or used

Privacy:

- explain Nostr metadata limits
- durable publishing warnings
- local vault storage

Legacy CryptPad:

- raw drive route
- raw link sharing
- compatibility login

## Mobile Layout

Mobile shell:

- bottom nav: Docs, Shared, New, Contacts, Settings
- wallet badge in top sheet
- editor header compressed to back, title, share, menu
- share flow as full-screen sheet
- no tiny sidebars or multi-column modals

## Visual Direction

Use a restrained operational SaaS style:

- clean table/list views
- compact panels
- clear icon buttons
- 8px radius or less
- neutral background with restrained accents
- avoid decorative gradients, giant cards, and stock CryptPad icon grids

Core color roles:

- background
- surface
- border
- text
- muted text
- primary action
- warning
- danger
- success

The UI should not be dominated by one hue family. Wallet/network states should use small status indicators rather than full-page color treatments.
